  ## Description

  This project was created to automate the creation of the README.md process. I built this project to make it easier, and hopefully faster, to create useful and professional READMEs. Due to the simplicity of this automated readme project, a user can now create readmes in minimal time allowing them to focus more on the project. This project helped me to better understand the inquirer package and the fs package used in node. I also learned more about template literals and ternary operators. Finally, I used two switch statements that helped me improve those skills as well.
